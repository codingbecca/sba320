A skills-based assessment for Per Scholas.
A simple one page React application that allows users to search via the Google Books API to retrieve cover images of books, add them to a 'shelf' section of the page and then print that shelf of books.
Use Case: keeping track of a to-be-read list, books owned, or books read in a certain period of time.
